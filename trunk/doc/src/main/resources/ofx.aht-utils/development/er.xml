	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
		An entity-relationship model is a systematic way of describing and defining a business process.
		The process is modeled as components (entities) that are linked with each other by relationships that
		express the dependencies and requirements between them, such as: one building may be divided into zero or
		more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building. Entities may have various properties
		(attributes) that characterize them. Diagrams created to represent these entities, attributes, and relationships
		graphically are called entityâ€“relationship diagrams.
