		LaTeX is a document preparation system and document markup language.
		It is widely used for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields,
		including mathematics, physics, and computer science.
		It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials,
		such as Sanskrit and Arabic.
		LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.
		LaTeX is not the name of a particular editing program,
		but refers to the encoding or tagging conventions that are used in LaTeX documents.

		In this context, LaTeX is used as an intermediate format as part of a pipeline for translating XML-based content to PDF.
		The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of
		typesetting and desktop publishing,
		including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics,
		page layout, indexing and bibliographies.
