				REST-compliant Web services, in which the primary purpose of the service is to manipulate
				representations of Web resources using a uniform set of stateless operations.

	    <l:item>
	    	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
				Arbitrary Web services, in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations.
				The Web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).
				Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using
				SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) messages,
				typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other
				Web-related standards.
