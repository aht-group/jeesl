	<ofx:paragraph lang="en" version="1">
		Debian is an operating system composed of free software mostly carrying the GNU General Public License.
		The operating system is developed by an Internet collaboration of volunteers aligned with The Debian Project.
	</ofx:paragraph>
	
	<ofx:paragraph lang="en" version="1">
		Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers.
		Debian is seen as a stable Linux distribution, and as a consequence has been used as a base for other Linux distributions,
		there are over 140 active Debian derivatives, one of the most popular ones is Ubuntu.
	</ofx:paragraph>
	
	<ofx:paragraph lang="en" version="1">
		Since Debian can be used free of charge, it can easily be obtained from the projects website. There is a huge variety of installation methods to choose from.
		A very convenient one is using the minimum installation CD. You can download the disk image for your architecture (mostly i386 for older 32-bit machines and amd64 for newer 64-bit CPUs like Intel Core processors and above) from http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst. Then the image needs to be written to a CD or DVD recordable.
		The Ubuntu project offers HowTos for all common operating systems like Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X and Linux on how to actually burn this image to the disk at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto.
		Once the CD or DVD is prepared, the computer needs to be booted from the optical disk drive and the (non-graphical) installer should be selected from the boot screen.
		The Debian installer then guides you through the complete setup process.

				The total data storage space of a PC HDD can contain at most four primary partitions,

				Please select "Guided - use entire disk". Now select

			The Apache HTTP Server  is the world's most widely used web server software.
			Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of Apache began in early 1995 after

			World Wide Web, quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server,
			and has remained the most popular HTTP server since April 1996.
			In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million websites.

			Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers
			under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.
			Most commonly used on a Unix-like system (usually Linux),
			the software is available for a wide variety of operating systems,
			including Windows, OS X, Linux, Unix, FreeBSD, Solaris, NetWare, OS/2, TPF, OpenVMS and eComStation. Released under the Apache License, Apache is free and open-source software.

		As of June 2013, Apache was estimated to serve 54.2% of all active website and 53.3%

				then the system will invoke the requested command.
				The sudoers configuration file enables a huge amount of configurability, including but not
				limited to: enabling root commands only from the invoking terminal; not requiring a password
				for certain commands; requiring a password per user or group; requiring re-entry of a password
				every time or never requiring a password at all for a particular command line.
				It can also be configured to permit passing arguments or multiple commands,
				and even supports commands with regular expressions.
