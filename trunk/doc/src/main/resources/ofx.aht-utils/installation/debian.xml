				The Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication,
				remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between
				two networked computers. For this system it is used for the administrator to remotely login
				to the system and excute shell commands.
			</ofx:paragraph>
			
			<ofx:paragraph lang="en" version="1">
				SSH can be installed using the built-in tool "apt-get":

			<ofx:listing>
				<ofx:raw>apt-get install ssh</ofx:raw>
			</ofx:listing>
			
			<ofx:paragraph lang="en" version="1">
				A common used best practice for running SSH on a server is to deactivate the authentication by password
				and the permission for the user <ofx:emphasis italic="true">root</ofx:emphasis> to log in remotely.

				First of all, a cryptographic key has to be generated on the computer of the user. This procedure varies

				 The terminal pager program less is used to view (but not change) the contents of a text file one
				 screen at a time. It is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both forward
				 and backward navigation through the file.
				 Unlike most Unix text editors/viewers, less does not need to read the entire file before starting,
				 resulting in faster load times with large files.
