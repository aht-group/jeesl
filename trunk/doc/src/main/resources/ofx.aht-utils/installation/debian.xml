			 The terminal pager program less is used to view (but not change) the contents of a text file one
			 screen at a time. It is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both forward
			 and backward navigation through the file.
			 Unlike most Unix text editors/viewers, less does not need to read the entire file before starting,
			 resulting in faster load times with large files.
