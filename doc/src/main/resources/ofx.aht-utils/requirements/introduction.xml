        In order to have a safe and secure system that performs well, some requirements need to be fulfilled.
        These requirement does not only include the hardware, but also the software environment that the application
        is deployed in and the staff that is selected to install and maintain the information system.
        Furthermore, since it is a system that is used through a network connection by its clients, the
        network infrastructure must be stable and fast.
        The fulfillment of all requirements is a critical success factor
        for the sustainable and safe operation of the system.
