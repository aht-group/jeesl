		A web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network.
		It is a software function provided at a network address over the web with the service always on
		as in the concept of utility computing.
		The <text:emphasis bold="true">W3C</text:emphasis> defines a web service generally as a software system designed to support interoperable
		machine-to-machine interaction over a network.

	    	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
				REST-compliant web services, in which the primary purpose of the service is to manipulate
				representations of web resources using a uniform set of state less operations.
			</ofx:paragraph>
	    </l:item>
	    <l:item>
	    	<ofx:paragraph lang="en">
				Arbitrary web services, in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations.
				The web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).
				Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using
				SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) messages,
				typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialisation in conjunction with other
				web-related standards.
