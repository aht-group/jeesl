		The Use-Cases area of the administrator page describes rules for views and actions combined in a group.
		Every Use-Case is categorized and divided into several categories to create a better overview, like the "Views and Actions" page.
		It is also possible to edit or change the names and descriptions for every Use-Case level.
		This site is set up hierarchically, from a Use-Case name to the "Views and Actions", where you can add or remove single rules for each type.
		If you want to add or remove a rule to an existing Use-Case, simply press the green add button and select the wanted entry or 
		click the red remove button to delete the selected item. These changes takes effect without saving the rule.
