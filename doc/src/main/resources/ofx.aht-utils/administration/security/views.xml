		In the Views and Actions section of the administration page, you are able to edit the "Views and Actions" of a user. 
		Every existing view is categorized and divided into several categories to create a better overview.
		Choose a category and select the view you want to edit. The entries (Name/Description) on the right side are the editable items of the
		actual selected view. 
		Every linked action is provided by the developers and not editable by the LIS system administrator. If you want to save
		your current changes, press the save button on the upper right side of your window. Every change takes effect after relogging
		into the system.
