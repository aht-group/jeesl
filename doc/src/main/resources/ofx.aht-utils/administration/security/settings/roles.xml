	The Roles administration page describes the function of a single person in this system and grants permissions to them.
	Roles are divided into specific categories and you get a list of the existing roles per category.
	It is possible to add separate views, actions and use-cases for each role by clicking on the green add button located at the top of each rule-type.
	After changing rights and permissions for a role, save the new role configuration. 
	These changes takes effect after the edited user is relogging to the system.
