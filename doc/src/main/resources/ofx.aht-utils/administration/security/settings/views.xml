		Every view is divided into several categories to achieve a better overview.
		Choose a category and select the view you want to edit. The entries (Name/Description) on the right side are the editable items of the
		actual selected view. 
		Every linked action is provided by the developers and not editable by the MEIS system administrator. If you want to save
		your current changes, press the save button on the upper right side. Every change takes effect after the edited user is relogging into the system.
